            <h2 class="hi">Hi!</h2>
            <p class="profile-p">Welcome to my page! My name is Yudisthira. I am currently a College student majoring in Informatics Engineering. This page will be my archives of all projects that I will be doing. Some things about me is that I love to read(trying to), love to code(also trying to), and love to watch(been on and off). As you may see, I love cats, thus why the theme of this web is cats! I guess that's all from me. Other than that, Please bear with me on this journey haha, thank you! </p>

                    <p class="code-p">Currently, I have been enjoying what is known as coding. I have average knowledge of C, Java, HTML, and CSS. Coding has been fun to me due to how flexible I can create something and so many possibilities that I can explore. I will use all my understanding to create what you have imagined to be a real-legit-nice-cool web!</p>

                    <p class="read-p">Read and write do be something that sparks something inside me. I have made some poems that I upload privately. I also have been reading a couple of books such as Second Place, Every Word You Cannot Say, and Solar. Both reading and writing spark my creativity in doing content writing. So if you ever need help, reach out to me!</p>

                    <p class="photo-p">Photography is such a cool thing. You can print out an exact moment on a piece of paper or even on a file. That way, you can always cherish your moment at any time. I've been diving into photography since 2020 with Canon AF35ML (analog), Instax Mini Evo (Polaroid), a phone camera, and also a digital camera that I could not remember the name is. I actually do not recommend you to ask for help from me, especially about photography HAHAHA, cause I am not the kind of professional person. I photograph purely with no knowledge and love!</p>

                    <p class="spotify-p">Making a playlist is something that I do regularly. On record, I currently have 32 Spotify playlists. All with different types of emotions. THOUGH, SAD IS ON A DAILY BASIS HAHA. I made these playlists with heart and dedication that I could never give to anything else. I love my playlists. I WILL GLADLY, WITH ALL MY HEART TRY MAKING YOU A PLAYLIST IF YOU EVER ASK ME TO!</p>
